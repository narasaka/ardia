# Ardia on Linux

The Linux port shares the Mac's and Windows' TypeScript UI (`apps/browser/src`, `packages/*/src`) and is laid out like
the Windows port (`docs/windows.md`): an app project under `apps/browser/linux`, an `expo-modules-core` replacement in
`packages/expo-linux`, platform files named `*.linux.ts(x)` beside the shared ones, scripts in `scripts/linux`, CI in
`.github/workflows/linux.yml`. The work lands on the `linux` branch of the fork, which starts from the Windows branch
(PR #1116) so the shared platform layer (`lib/platformFeatures`, `lib/platformChrome`, `lib/platformTerms`,
`platform/windowControls`, the app-drawn window buttons) serves both.

## Design

| Layer | Linux |
| --- | --- |
| Process and engine | Electron (Chromium + Node), `apps/browser/linux` |
| UI | The shared TypeScript, bundled by Vite for the browser with `react-native-web`, run in one renderer |
| `expo-modules-core` | `packages/expo-linux`: native modules are the main process's, reached through the preload bridge |
| Pages | Electron `<webview>` elements inside the UI's DOM, one per tab, partition `persist:<profile>` |
| Windows | Frameless `BrowserWindow`s, each a child the one UI runtime opened and renders into |
| Chrome services | Written in TypeScript in the main process (history, bookmarks, favicons, downloads, permissions, passwords) |

### One runtime, many windows

The Mac and Windows run one JS runtime that mounts a root per window. On Linux one hidden `BrowserWindow`, the host,
loads the UI bundle. Every app window (browser, Little Ardia, Settings, Import) is opened from the host with
`window.open('about:blank', <windowId>)`: Electron keeps it in the host's renderer process and same origin, so the host
mounts a React root into the child's document, and every window shares the one zustand store. The main process
shapes those windows in `setWindowOpenHandler` (frameless, transparent, sizes from `ArdiaAppWindows.openWindow`).
Closing a window unmounts its root. The host is never shown and lives until quit.

`ArdiaAppWindows.openWindow` (`packages/expo-linux/src/windows/appWindows.ts`) asks main to shape the window
(`shapeWindow`, in `apps/browser/linux/src/modules/appWindows.ts`), opens it, mounts `AppRegistry.runApplication("main",
{ windowId })` into its `#root`, and asks main to show it after the first paint (fading in when `animated`). Closing
unmounts first, then main closes it; a window closed by the window manager asks the UI first (`closeRequest`) for
browser and Little Ardia windows. When the last app window closes, main runs the quit handshake (`willQuit`,
`replyToTerminate`). Windows are rounded (12 px, a 1 px edge) except maximized or full screen;
`windowCornerRadius()` is the Mac's 19 so the page card keeps Dia's 10 pt radius.

`react-native-web` gives each window's document its own copy of its style sheet; other `<style>` and stylesheet links
in the host's head are mirrored and kept in sync (`host/documentStyles.ts`). `host/acrossWindows.ts` makes the host
answer for its windows: listeners added on the host's `window` or `document` for input, focus, resize and scroll are
added to every app window too (react-native-web's responder system, `Pressable`'s key handling and the UI's own
listeners need no changes), `document.activeElement`, `hasFocus()`, `visibilityState` and `getSelection()` read the
focused window, `ResizeObserver` and `IntersectionObserver` observe each element with its own window's observer
(`onLayout` depends on it), and `instanceof Node`/`Element`/`Event` accept objects from any app window.

Native views are drawn in the DOM (`packages/expo-linux/src/views/registry.tsx`, most ported from the web demo):
`Symbol`, `Surface`, `VisualEffect` (nearly opaque: a transparent Linux window can't blur the desktop), glass, popover
bubbles, `FadeLabel`, the spinner, the pager's `SwipeArea`, the GL backdrop and power-up (with CSS fallbacks where WebGL2
is blocklisted), and `WindowDragRegion`, which moves the window from main by following the cursor (so it also works
without a window manager); a double-click maximizes. The engine's views (`ArdiaWebView`) come from
`engine/modules`' `engineViews`. A text field taking or losing focus is reported to main
(`ArdiaFocus.setTextInputFocused`) for the shortcut table; `claimFocus` and the key-responder calls take DOM nodes and
stay in the renderer. Linux uses the Windows chrome (app-drawn window buttons), keys and copy wording through
`*.linux.ts` files that re-export the Windows ones, and its own `platformFeatures.linux.ts` and `platformTerms.linux.ts`.

### Pages are `<webview>` elements

`ArdiaWebView` renders a `<webview>` in place, so the UI draws over pages, clips their corners and animates them like
any other element. The main process owns each page's `webContents` (`webContents.fromId(getWebContentsId())`) and
answers the engine domains (`tabs.*`, `history.*`, …) from it.

### The bridge

`apps/browser/linux/src/preload.ts` gives the host renderer `window.ardiaLinux`:

```ts
type LinuxBridge = {
  modules(): Record<string, { sync: string[]; async: string[]; constants?: Record<string, unknown> }>;
  callSync(module: string, method: string, args: unknown[]): unknown;
  call(module: string, method: string, args: unknown[]): Promise<unknown>;
  onEvent(listener: (module: string, event: string, payload: unknown) => void): () => void;
};
```

Main-process modules live one per file in `apps/browser/linux/src/modules/<Name>.ts` and register with
`defineModule(name, { sync, async, constants })`. A module emits events with `emit(module, event, payload)`, which
reaches JS as `emitNativeEvent(module, event, payload)`, the same channel the Mac's `addListener` uses. In
`packages/expo-linux`, `requireNativeModule(name)` answers each property in this order: a TypeScript wrapper around
the main method where one is needed (`aroundMain` in `tsModules.ts`), the main process's module (sync methods through
`callSync`, async through `call`), modules written in TypeScript (`writtenInTs`), the engine's modules, the services',
`defaults.ts`, then an inert method that logs its name once (`ardiaLinuxMissing()` in the console lists them).

## The main process

- **Launch config.** `src/launch.ts` and `src/paths.ts` are the only files that read the environment (`ARDIA_DATA_DIR`,
  `ARDIA_BACKGROUND`, `ARDIA_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT`, `ARDIA_INSTANCE`, `ARDIA_SWITCHES`, `ARDIA_TRACE`, `ARDIA_TEST`,
  `ARDIA_FEEDBACK_URL`). A test instance is an `ARDIA_DATA_DIR` outside `~/.local/share/ardia` and `~/.config/ardia`;
  only there do `ARDIA_TEST` and `ARDIA_TRACE` count. Linux adds the trace area `keys` (every key press, its
  webContents and window). The main process logs to stdout and `<data>/launch.log`.
- **Documents.** `ArdiaDocuments` stages each write in memory (a read right after sees it) and lands it with an
  atomic replace (temp file, fsync, rename), one at a time, retrying with backoff; quitting flushes synchronously.
- **Quit.** `before-quit`, SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP emit `willQuit`; the UI saves and answers
  `ArdiaAppWindows.replyToTerminate`, and Ardia exits, or exits anyway after 3 s (`src/quit.ts`).
- **Keyboard shortcuts.** The Windows command table, ported (`src/menus`), runs on `before-input-event` of every
  webContents, with Ctrl where the Mac has ⌘ and the user's remapped shortcuts. A `<webview>`'s keys arrive at the
  page's and the host's webContents, so they go to the page's window (`resolvePageWindowsWith`), else the focused app
  window. Context menus are native Electron menus; background instances log them to `activation.log` instead.
- **Launch links.** URLs and files on the command line wait for the first window; a second launch with the same data
  folder hands its links to the running app (`second-instance`), or opens a window (`--new-window`) or reopens one.
- **Default browser and login.** `xdg-settings set default-web-browser ardia.desktop` (an AppImage first writes
  `~/.local/share/applications/ardia.desktop` and its icons); open at login is `~/.config/autostart/ardia.desktop`.
- **Updates** come from the GitHub releases of the repository the build was made from (`ARDIA_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` at
  build time): Ardia checks every 6 hours and offers the release page; it doesn't update itself yet.
- **Secrets** (`ArdiaKeychain`) are sealed with `safeStorage` (the desktop keyring through libsecret or KWallet; with
  no keyring Electron falls back to its `basic_text` key).

## Sandbox

Chromium decides before any JavaScript runs, and aborts when the setuid helper is present but not setuid root and user
namespaces are unusable, so the decision is a shell function (`apps/browser/linux/packaging/sandbox.sh`) that the
packaged `ardia` launcher, `pnpm dev` and `scripts/linux/test-instance` run first: unprivileged user namespaces when the
kernel allows them and AppArmor doesn't restrict them (or a profile grants `userns` to the binary), else a setuid-root
`chrome-sandbox`, else `--no-sandbox`. The launcher passes the reason on and `launch.log` records it. The `.deb`'s
postinst always makes `chrome-sandbox` setuid root (electron-builder's own keeps it 0755 whenever
`unshare --user true` succeeds, which it does on Ubuntu 24.04 even though AppArmor then blocks Chromium's namespace
sandbox) and installs an AppArmor profile that grants `userns` to `/opt/Ardia/ardia.bin`. An AppImage can't carry a
setuid helper, so it is sandboxed where user namespaces work and runs with `--no-sandbox` elsewhere.

## Packaging

`pnpm -C apps/browser/linux package [--arch x64|arm64|all] [--target AppImage|deb|dir|all]` stages `out/` and `ui/`
(no source maps) with a `package.json` that has no dependencies, since the main process is one esbuild bundle, and
electron-builder makes `dist/Ardia-<version>-<arch>.AppImage` and `.deb`. The Electron binary ships as `ardia.bin`
behind the `ardia` launcher script; `ardia.desktop` has `StartupWMClass=ardia` (Electron names the windows' class
after the desktop file), the `http`/`https`/`text/html` handlers and a New Window action. The version and build number come from the Mac project (`scripts/version.mjs`), the
icons from its asset catalog, the intro music from the Windows build.

## Paths

Data in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ardia` (default `~/.local/share/ardia`) or `ARDIA_DATA_DIR`, config in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ardia`. Test instances always set `ARDIA_DATA_DIR`.

## Running it

- `pnpm -C apps/browser/linux dev`: Vite serves the UI, Electron loads it.
- `pnpm -C apps/browser/linux build`: the UI bundle and the main process, then `package` makes the AppImage and `.deb`
  in `apps/browser/linux/dist`.
- Headless: `scripts/linux/xvfb <display> -- <command>` runs a command on a virtual display (the system Xvfb, or one
  unpacked in `~/.local/xvfb`).
- `scripts/linux/test-instance <name> [--port N] [--display N] [--data DIR] [--app PATH] [-- <links>]` builds nothing,
  starts a hidden instance on its own Xvfb with its own `ARDIA_DATA_DIR` and debugging port, waits for the port and
  prints the pid; `--stop` quits it through the quit handshake and stops its Xvfb. `--app` runs a packaged build (an
  extracted AppImage folder or `/opt/Ardia`).
- `scripts/linux/capture <port> <out-dir>` screenshots every app window and page over CDP.
- `scripts/linux/launch-smoke <out-dir> [--app PATH]` is CI's check: a fresh instance with a fixture page as a launch
  link, the first window and the loaded page within 90 s, screenshots, a clean quit and a saved session.
- CI (`.github/workflows/linux.yml`) runs on pushes and PRs to `linux`, on x64 and arm64: typecheck, build, package,
  the smoke on the checkout's build and on the extracted AppImage under `xvfb-run`, checks of the `.deb`, and uploads
  the screenshots, logs, AppImage and `.deb`.
